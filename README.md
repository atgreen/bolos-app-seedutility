[This repository](https://github.com/parkerhoyes/bolos-app-seedutility) contains
an application for the [Ledger Nano
S](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-nano-s) that allows the user to verify the
backup of their BIP 39 mnemonic by comparing it to the master seed stored on the
device.

## Development Cycle

This repository will follow a Git branching model similar to that described in
[Vincent Driessen's *A successful Git branching
model*](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and a
versioning scheme similar to that defined by [Semantic Versioning
2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
