# BOLOS Seed Utility App v1.0.0

[This repository](https://github.com/parkerhoyes/bolos-app-seedutility) contains
an application for the [Ledger Nano
S](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-nano-s) that allows the user to verify the
backup of their BIP 39 mnemonic by comparing it to the master seed stored on the
device.

An extensive manual for the application as well as some screenshots can be found
in the `docs` folder.

Precompiled versions of this application as well as installation instructions
are available [on my website](https://parkerhoyes.com/bolos-apps).

## Development Cycle

This repository will follow a Git branching model similar to that described in
[Vincent Driessen's *A successful Git branching
model*](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and a
versioning scheme similar to that defined by [Semantic Versioning
2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
